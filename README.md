A simple introduction to amazon web services. 
There are two files in which the following modules are used.
<li><a href ="https://github.com/boto/boto">boto</a> </li>
<li> amazon aws </li>
<li> MySQLdb </li>
<li> Memcache </li>

In this project you create an instance in amazon aws i.e an <b> RDS </b> instance. 
Once the instance is created you get the end point and provide it in the connection parameters.

You will create the schema using mysql and this program uses the memcache to retrieve the data very quickly.

Check it out.!!
